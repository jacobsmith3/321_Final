# Alphabet Game (CPTS 321 Final)

This Project is a final given to me that was to make a project that uses shapes to make letters for kids. This project uses winforms, .NET, and C#. In the game you are given long line,short line, big curve, and little curve. Using these shapes you click on the ones that can make the letters using a factory that makes it easy to refactor if needed and uses inheritence to connect letters to the factory.
